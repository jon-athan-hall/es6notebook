/**
 * Babel compiles ES6 code down to its ES5 equivalent.
 * Use `npm init` to create a package.json file.
 * Then `npm install babel-cli` for the compiler.
 * Then `npm install babel-preset-env` for what ES6 features you need to compile.
 * Create a .babelrc file to create for settings, or add a "babel" object
 * to the package.json file, then finally add what browsers you'd like to support.

/**
 * Also, use polyfills to cover for older browsers too. Find a
 * module at Babel, or visit polyfill.io for usage.
